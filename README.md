# 🧬 Disease Prediction Using Patient Data

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project for predicting diseases such as diabetes or heart disease using patient health data. It is part of Week 1 ML learning series.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, encoding)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Training Logistic Regression & Random Forest models

Model evaluation & comparison using accuracy

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Dataset

    Patient medical data from the UCI ML Repository.

2. Preprocessing

    Fill missing values with mean/median

    Normalize numerical features to [0, 1]

    Encode categorical variables with Label Encoding

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    View statistical summary with describe()

    Plot correlation heatmap

4. Model Training

    Logistic Regression

    Random Forest Classifier

5. Evaluation

    Metric: Accuracy

    Compare models and select the better one

6. Outcome

    A 1-page report summarizing steps, EDA insights, model performance, and conclusions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Results

Comparison of Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Accuracy as the key performance metric

Final model selection based on best results
